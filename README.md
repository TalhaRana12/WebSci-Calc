# WebSci Calc 🧮

A robust scientific calculator for the web that bridges the gap between traditional handheld calculators and modern web interfaces. This project supports standard arithmetic as well as complex scientific functions including trigonometry, logarithms, and exponential values.


## 🚀 Features

*   **Scientific Functions:** Square ($x^2$), Cube ($x^3$), Square Root ($\sqrt{}$), $\sin$, $\cos$, $\tan$, $\log_{10}$, and $\ln$.
*   **Constants:** Built-in support for $\pi$ and Euler's number ($e$).
*   **Dual Input:** Fully functional via mouse clicks or keyboard typing.
*   **Keyboard Accessibility:** Custom key mappings for scientific functions (e.g., press 's' for sin).
*   **Responsive Design:** Works on desktop and mobile devices.

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

To make calculations faster, you can use your keyboard. Here is the mapping guide:

| Key | Function | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0-9** | Numbers | Input numbers |
| **+ - * /** | Operators | Standard arithmetic |
| **Enter** | `=` | Calculate result |
| **Backspace** | `⌫` | Delete last character |
| **Delete** | `Clear` | Clear display |
| **s** | `sin(` | Sine function |
| **c** | `cos(` | Cosine function |
| **t** | `tan(` | Tangent function |
| **l** | `log(` | Base-10 Logarithm |
| **n** | `ln(` | Natural Logarithm |
| **p** | `π` | Pi Constant |
| **e** | `e` | Euler's Number |
| **^** | `^` | Power operator |

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** Semantic structure.
*   **CSS3:** Styling and grid layout for the calculator keys.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** Logic for calculation, DOM manipulation, and event listening for keyboard inputs.
